## Featured Projects

**Crop Yield Forecasting Using MLP**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/ozozcelikoglu/cropyield-forecast-mlp)  
Forecasts next-year crop yields for 130 countries using climate and soil data. Built with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and evaluated on real unseen 2021 data.

- Integrated 17 CSV datasets, performed preprocessing and country matching
- Feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch)
- Final R²: 0.738, MAE: 1,267.17

**Open University VLE Analysis**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/ozozcelikoglu/open-university-vle-analysis)  
Investigates the relationship between student interaction with a virtual learning environment and academic performance using the OULAD dataset.

- Merged and analyzed 7+ relational data tables (~10M records)
- Performed EDA, statistical testing (t-tests), and regression modeling
- Final logistic regression model: Accuracy 77.3%, F1 Score 77.2%
- Identified at-risk groups and provided policy recommendations

**C-Section Risk Analysis – CSW 2025 Dataset**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/ozozcelikoglu/ozozcelikoglu-csection-risk-analysis)  
Logistic regression model to identify clinical and maternal risk factors associated with Caesarean delivery.

- Confidence intervals, odds ratios, and stratified analysis
- BMI and first-time birth status were key predictors
- Multivariate modeling showed cervical length as a modifying factor

**Galaxy Mass Analysis & Statistical Modeling**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/ozozcelikoglu/galaxy-mass-analysis-montecarlo-mcmc)  
Statistical modeling project involving physical data simulation, polynomial regression, and Bayesian parameter estimation via MCMC.

- Simulated muon decay using inverse transform sampling
- Compared polynomial models using chi-square, AIC, and BIC
- Modeled galaxy mass distribution with Schechter function and MCMC (emcee)
- Estimated posterior distributions and visualized parameter uncertainty
