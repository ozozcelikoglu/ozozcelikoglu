## Why Data Analysis?

I believe that data is only valuable when it can inform decisions. I enjoy exploring patterns, verifying hypotheses, and communicating findings through compelling dashboards or well-structured reports. Whether it’s reconciling financial data across risk systems or building predictive models, I focus on delivering value through accuracy, scalability, and clarity.

My analytical mindset, strong SQL background, and experience working with cross-functional teams enable me to navigate both the technical and business sides of a project.
